"AI-Powered Container Fleet Manager" – Run your entire Docker/K8s empire by chatDevOps teams pay $1000s for Lens/Argo but still SSH everywhere.Docker Hub MCP + Kubernetes MCP + GitHub MCP + Filesystem MCP + Testkube MCP + Browserbase MCPAgent can “show me all images older than 90 days” (Docker Hub) → “upgrade them to latest secure version” → builds new images in E2B sandbox → runs tests → rolls out to k8s with zero-downtime plan → shows live preview via Browserbase.This is the first natural-language fleet manager that actually executes safely. Every company running containers will want this yesterday.



Dependency Nightmare Fixer" – Never have outdated/vulnerable deps againSecurity teams pay Snyk/Dependabot $100k+/year but still get breached because fixes break things.Maven Tools MCP + GitHub MCP + Docker Hub MCP + Filesystem MCP + Testkube MCP + Kubernetes MCPAgent scans all repos → uses Maven Tools to find latest safe versions → checks Docker Hub for base image updates → creates branch → runs full Testkube suite in E2B sandbox → if green, opens PR or directly applies to k8s fleet.This is the first dependency updater that actually tests before breaking production. Every Java/K8s shop will throw money at you.45"Production Firefighter" – When sh*t hits the fan at 3amSREs get paged and spend hours correlating logs, metrics, traces manually.Elasticsearch MCP + Temporal MCP + Kubernetes MCP + GitHub MCP + Browserbase MCP + Metabase MCPAgent gets alerted → pulls last 1h logs from ES → finds related Temporal workflows → checks k8s pod logs → finds the exact commit that caused it (GitHub) → rolls back or hotfixes in E2B sandbox first → shows you 30-second video of the fix working.This is literally what PagerDuty + Datadog promise but never deliver. Demo a simulated outage → fixed in <2 minutes live on stage = you win everything.



"AI Chaos Monkey" – Intelligent chaos engineering for any Kubernetes clusterTeams pay Chaos Mesh + Gremlin $10k+/mo but still ship broken apps because experiments are manual/dumb.Kubernetes MCP + Testkube MCP + GitHub MCP + Temporal MCP + Filesystem MCP + Browserbase MCPEvery chaos experiment runs in its own temporary E2B sandbox first → injects faults, runs full test suites, records video → only applies to real cluster after user approval. Persistent sandbox keeps chaos history + dashboards.Demo: point at any public k8s cluster → agent finds weak spots, runs 5 experiments, shows which ones would have killed prod. Judges will freak — this is the first chaos tool that’s actually intelligent and safe.
